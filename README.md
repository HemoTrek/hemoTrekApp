# HemoTrek: Compact Rapid Blood Viscometer

## ABSTRACT

Hyperviscosity syndrome (HVS) is an urgent and potentially fatal medical condition characterized by abnormally viscous blood. Current medical systems lack solutions for rapidly and conveniently measuring blood viscosities. As a result, cases of HVS are not detected at early stages, and risky and expensive procedures are often undertaken without a conclusive diagnosis. A compact rapid blood viscometer was designed to fulfill this gap in medical practice. The device integrates a single-sample centrifuge, an automated pipette, and a capillary tube viscometer to provide automated whole blood and serum viscosity measurements using only 4 mL of blood in under 30 minutes. This allows the clinical team to identify the source of increased viscosity and determine treatment plans. Self-sterilization, a touchscreen interface, and modular components make use easy without additional training. Testing with sheep blood provided limited and inconsistent results due to sensor inaccuracies as well as time and material limitations. The measured whole blood mean viscosity of 7.1 cP is significantly larger than the expected result of 3.91 cP. While the difference is partially expected and accounted for, paths for improvement have been identified and further testing is required to refine the system. All other system components functioned well.
